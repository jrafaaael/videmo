				 * Previously, recordings that were drag-n-drop'd in Videmo were saved with their original filename. However, when users record directly from Chrome,
				 * their filename is the recording date in UTC. This is a problem because OPFS sort files alphabetically, so:
				 * 1. some recordings that were drag-n-drop'd are listed at top of recording list, even if the last user video was recorded directly from Chrome.
				 * 2. some recordings that were drag-n-drop'd are listed at bottom of recording list, even if this was the latest video in Videmo.
				 * With this conditional, I rename folders with original filename from drag-n-drop'd recordings and save it with the current date in UTC as filename
				 * to keep compatibility with the old behavior. However, this create a new problem: users will search their recordings with original name because
				 * those recordings were saved with this behavior. To solve this, in their associated object value in localStorage,
				 * I create a new key called `name` to save the original name. This allows me to develop some new features:
				 * 1. rename recordings
				 * 2. sort recordings alphabetically and by date
